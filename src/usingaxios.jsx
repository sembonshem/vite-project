// /* The commented section in the code is explaining the key differences between using Axios and the
fetch API in JavaScript React for making HTTP requests. It highlights three main points: */
Key Differences with Axios
// Response Handling: fetch only rejects a promise on network errors, 
// meaning it wonâ€™t reject on HTTP status codes (like 404 or 500). 
// You need to check the response.ok status to handle errors explicitly. 
// Axios, on the other hand, automatically rejects requests that fall outside the 2xx range.
// Config and Features: Axios comes with built-in support for advanced features like request cancelation, 
// timeouts, and automatic JSON transformation, which can be added manually in fetch but requires more work.
// Ease of Customization: Axios allows setting up interceptors for requests and responses, 
// which can be very useful for handling authentication tokens or logging.
